# Distributed Systems Learning Journey

This repository is for documenting all the ideas, projects and clones i'll try to build as i'm learning about distributed systems. I am new to the game so i'm comming accross ton of new information every passing second, which is very overwhelming, but its fun to learn about how this complicated systems that power our every day life and work and the great ideas behind them. I've always been in love with systems especially interconnected systems and how they work together.

I have a special interest in internet and cloud/edge infrastructure and how they are built. After going through the basics, i plan to focus on those technologies.

For the basics and theories, i'm watching bunch of courses on youtube and reading tons of blog posts on the subject and whitepapers? i am knee deep in alot of them. And i use golng to build the projects.
